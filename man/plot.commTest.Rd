  x,
  which = 1,
  atlas = NULL,
  atlas.lab = NULL,
  match.labs = FALSE,

)

\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{commTest} object, typically result of
\link[FCharmony]{test_communities}}

\item{match.labs}{Whether to modify community labels to match across levels.}

\item{overlap.obj}{If matching labels, which objective function to use. All
are sum over all ROIs. 1 is number of overlapping labels, 2 is whether or
not all labels match, 3 is the number of unique labels (minimize), 4 is
a weighted sum between 1 and 2, giving more weight to having all same. 5 is
a weighted sum between 1 and 3, penalizing more distinct labels.}
