\usage{
fcCovBat(
  x,
  bat,
  mod = NULL,
  eb = TRUE,
  to.corr = TRUE,
  out.pd = FALSE,
  fisher = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\emph{p x p x n} covariance or correlation matrices where \emph{p} is the number
of ROIs and \emph{n} is the number of subjects.}

\item{bat}{Factor (or object coercible by \link[base]{as.factor} to a
factor) of length \emph{n} designating batch IDs.}

\item{mod}{Optional design matrix of covariates to preserve, usually from
the output of \link[stats]{model.matrix}.}

\item{eb}{If `TRUE``, uses ComBat model with empirical Bayes for mean
and variance harmonization.}

\item{to.corr}{If \code{TRUE}, uses \link[stats]{cov2cor} to convert input
matrices into correlation matrices}

\item{out.pd}{Whether input should be forced to be positive definite using
\link[Matrix]{nearPD}. This step is unnecessary for many downstream
network analyses so defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{fisher}{Whether to Fisher-transform the off-diagonal elements before
applying CovBat, highly recommended that this be set to \code{TRUE}.}
